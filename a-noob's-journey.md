# CS-journey

Currently I have zero knowledge about anything IT, Computer Science, or Cyber Security. I will use this repo to journal everything I've done, and won't be super formal, I'll create a better one later on when I have a better grasp on how to use GitHub. Dream job is something in Digital Forensics but trying to keep my options open. Cybersecurity is the direction I would like to head in however. Anyways, here we go!
