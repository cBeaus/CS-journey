# CS-journey

> Day 0:

Currently I have zero knowledge about anything IT, Computer Science, or Cyber Security. I'll be using this repo to journal everything I've done, and won't be formal by any means. I'll create a better and more organized repos later on when I have a better grasp on how to use GitHub. Dream job is something in Digital Forensics but trying to keep my options open. Cybersecurity is the general direction I would like to head in. Anyways, here we go!

> (5/28/25) Day 1: TryHackMe

I did my first room and I just have to say, my mind has been opened! I remember the exact command I put into the Ubuntu terminal; "gobuster -u (http:)//fakebank.thm -w wordlist dir" and got a decent sense of what gobuster is (I still have some questions haha), I understand that "-u" is used to state the website and the "-w wordlist.txt dir" takes from the wordlist text document I found on the desktop. Not sure exactly what "dir" means, I assume it's the directory, and still have some questions but I'm sure it'll all become a lot more clear as I keep going through rooms. This all fell under offensive security, in the VM we pretty much simulated a hack I guess you could call it, looked for vunerbilities. 

Next I dipped my toes a bit into defensive security. Essentially the exercise went like this: unauthorized user was detected through the SIEM, their IP was from China and they had successfully logged in. My job was to notify my hypothetical Security Operations Center Team Lead of the issue, and they gave me permission to block the hypothetical IP using the firewall block list. Super interesting stuff and would love to learn more fundamentals in regards to defensive security/ blue team.

This is all super lengthy and boring to read so I'll try to keep things concise next time I write in this repo. I may not come here every time I learn something but we'll see where things go I guess.
